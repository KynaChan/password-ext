# Password-account management system
### Project title: password management extension - the CatLocker

### Project vision: 
   * CatLocker is a web page to store usernames and test password strength for businesses, office workers and the majority of computer users.
   * It provides an online “notepad” for consumers to track on their user credentials any time with a simple click on the screen. The user does not need to switch the window or tab to look for the username and password which allows the user to increase productivity and reduce distraction.
